* Investigations of the software testing coupling effect
Offutt showed empirical support for one of the basic premises of mutation testing, that a test data set that detects simple faults (such as those introduced by mutation) will detect complex faults, i.e., the combination of several simple faults.

X. Cai and M. R. Lyu. The effect of code coverage on fault detection under different testing profiles. In International Workshop on Advances in Model-Based Testing, pages 1–7, 2005
 investigated the correlation between different coverage criteria—branch coverage, decision cover- age, P-use, and C-use—and fault detection, using a linear regression model
 Their results showed that coverage criteria were only a moderate indicator for fault detection, with large variance for different test suites.
