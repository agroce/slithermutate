"Differential" mutation analysis evaluation of static analysis for Solidity

To run the analysis, just:

1.  install universalmutator (`pip install universalmutator`)

2.  install, e.g., slither (`pip install slither-analyzer`)

3.  `python analzyeslither.py >& slither_stats.txt`

Installing Securify is a bit more work, but the analysis works the same and has the same interpretation.
